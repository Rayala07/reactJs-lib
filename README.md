# reactjs-lib ⚛️

Welcome to **reactjs-lib** — my personal React playground where components are born, broken, fixed, and reborn again.

This repo exists purely for **learning, experimenting, and occasionally asking React _“why are you like this?”_**.

## What’s inside 🧠

- React practice code  
- Concept experiments (some clean, some chaotic)  
- Learning notes I’ll thank myself for later  
- Components that worked… after multiple refreshes  
- Bugs that taught me more than tutorials ever did  

## Why this repository exists 🤷‍♂️

- To learn React by **actually using it**
- To break things safely and understand *why* they broke
- To track progress from “what is JSX?” to “okay this makes sense”
- To have a single place for all my React experiments  

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- React.js  
- JavaScript  
- Patience  
- Console logs  

## Structure 📁

(Organization improves as my React skills improve — no promises)

## Disclaimer ⚠️

- Code may evolve  
- Patterns may change  
- Logic may improve  
- But learning never stops

Built with curiosity, confusion, and a lot of `useEffect` debugging 😌
